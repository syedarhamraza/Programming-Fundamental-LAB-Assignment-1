## Task 2: Variable Declaration and Initialization
- **Difficulty**: Easy  

### Objective:
Learn how to declare and initialize variables in C++.

### Problem Statement:
Write a program that declares three variables: an integer, a floating-point number, and a string. Assign any values of your choice to these variables and print them using `cout`.

#### Example Output:
The value of the integer is: 25 The value of the floating-point number is: 19.99 The value of the string is: Hello, C++!

#### Deliverable:

## Task 3: Simple Mathematical Operations
- **Difficulty**: Easy to Medium  

### Objective:
Perform basic mathematical operations using variables.

### Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes two numbers (declare them directly in your code) and performs the following operations:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

#### Example Output:
The sum of the numbers is: 35 The difference of the numbers is: 15 The product of the numbers is: 350 The division of the numbers is: 3.5

#### Deliverable:

## Task 4: Basic Currency Conversion
- **Difficulty**: Medium  

### Objective:
Simulate a simple currency conversion using basic variables and operations.

### Problem Statement:
Create a program that stores a variable for a monetary amount in USD and converts it to Euros (EUR) and Japanese Yen (JPY). Assume the following conversion rates:
- 1 USD = 0.85 EUR
- 1 USD = 110 JPY

#### Example Output:
Amount in USD: 100 Amount in EUR: 85 Amount in JPY: 11000

#### Deliverable:
A program that converts a given USD value to EUR and JPY using simple multiplication.

## Task 5: Distance Conversion Application
- **Difficulty**: Medium  

### Objective:
Create a simple application that converts distances between kilometers and miles.

### Problem Statement:
Write a program that stores a distance in kilometers and converts it into miles. Use the following conversion factor:
- 1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles

#### Example Output:
Distance in kilometers: 10 Distance in miles: 6.21371

#### Deliverable:
A program that converts kilometers to miles using a predefined conversion factor.

## Task 6: Salary Calculator
- **Difficulty**: Medium  

### Objective:
Create a salary calculator to understand how mathematical operations can simulate simple business applications.

### Problem Statement:
Write a program that calculates the annual salary of an employee based on the monthly salary. It should store:
1. The employee's monthly salary.
2. A fixed tax rate of 10% that will be deducted from the monthly salary.

The program should:
- Calculate the monthly salary after tax.
- Calculate the total annual salary before and after tax.

#### Example Output:
Monthly Salary: $4000 Monthly Salary after tax: $3600 Annual Salary before tax: $48000 Annual Salary after tax: $43200

#### Deliverable:
A program that computes both the monthly and annual salary before and after tax deduction.

## Task 7: Simple Temperature Conversion Application
- **Difficulty**: Advanced  

### Objective:
Apply variable manipulation and basic operations to simulate a temperature conversion system.

### Problem Statement:
Create a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Use the following formulas for conversion:
- Fahrenheit to Celsius: `C = (F - 32) * 5/9`
- Celsius to Fahrenheit: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`

The program should:
1. Store a temperature in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit.
2. Store a temperature in Fahrenheit and convert it to Celsius.

#### Example Output:
Temperature in Celsius: 25 Temperature in Fahrenheit: 77 Temperature in Fahrenheit: 100 Temperature in Celsius: 37.7778

#### Deliverable:
A program that performs both Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius conversions.

## Task 8: Tough Scenario Budget Calculator for a Small Business
- **Difficulty**: Advanced  

### Objective:
Simulate a more complex scenario where students apply mathematical operations, understand real-world budgeting, and manage basic business variables.

### Problem Statement:
Create a simple budget calculator for a small business. The business has the following expenses:
- Rent: $1500 per month
- Employee Salaries: $3000 per month
- Utilities: $400 per month
- Other expenses: $300 per month

The business earns $10,000 in revenue per month. The program should calculate:
- The total monthly expenses.
- The remaining profit after subtracting expenses from revenue.
- Additionally, the program should calculate how much the business would save in a year if it keeps its profit every month.

#### Example Output:
Total monthly expenses: $5200 Remaining profit: $4800 Yearly savings: $57600

#### Deliverable:
A program that calculates the monthly budget, remaining profit, and yearly savings for the business.
